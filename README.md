# Silent Failure in HTML: Accessing Non-Existent Element's innerHTML

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in HTML where attempting to modify the `innerHTML` of a non-existent element results in a silent failure.  No error is thrown, and the code simply has no effect, making it difficult to debug.

## The Bug

The `bug.html` file contains JavaScript code that attempts to modify the `innerHTML` of an element with the ID "nonExistentElement." However, this element does not exist in the HTML structure.  This results in a silent failure; the code executes without throwing any errors, but the intended modification does not occur.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.html` file demonstrates the solution. Before attempting to modify the `innerHTML`, it first checks if the element exists using `document.getElementById()`. If the element does not exist, a suitable alternative action can be taken (such as logging an error or displaying an appropriate message).
